# Album Release Cataloging Apps (ARCA)

This repo contains 2 apps:
- A `tkinter` app built in **Python** to store music catalog information to `json` format.
- A **Streamlit** app built in **Python** (using the `agraph` library) to illusatrate and parse music catalog information. At this point, it is a _work-in-progress_ and, as yet, doesn't contain full functionality. Future revisions might jettison `agraph` in favor of `matplotlib` and `networkx` instead.
